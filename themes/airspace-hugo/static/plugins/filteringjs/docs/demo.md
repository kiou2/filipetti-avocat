# [Demo]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.url}})

> Note: As shown in the [performance section here]({{site.baseurl}}/#performance), the performance for even a huge number of items is incredible. The demo however uses simple CSS transitions to animate show and hide filtered items causing the container and items to reflow multiple times. This is not recommended for a large dataset but still looks good enough for demonstration purposes.
